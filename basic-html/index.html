            <p>Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally
                think
                of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits
                other
                groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Legal reasons: In some places, it is a legal requirement that websites are accessible to people with
                    disabilities.</li>
                <li>Moral reasons: We should do our best to ensure our content can be used by as many people as possible.</li>
                <li>SEO: Search engines give better rankings to sites that are accessible.</li>
                <li>Mobile: Many of the considerations for accessibility also make your site better for mobile users.</li>

                <p>Accessibility is important for many reasons, and it is something that we should all be thinking about when
                    building
                    websites. By ensuring your sites are accessible, you are making your content available to a larger number of
                    people, regardless of their abilities.</p>
